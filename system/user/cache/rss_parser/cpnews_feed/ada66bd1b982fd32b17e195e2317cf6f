				<p>ExpressionEngine has always been loved by the EE community for the impact it&#8217;s had on so many of our lives and careers. Over the years, ExpressionEngine has helped most of us look like rock star designers &amp; developers to our clients!</p>

<p>So two years ago, when the topic of Packet Tide taking the helm of ExpressionEngine first came up, we knew it was something to take seriously. It was a privilege that came with a lot of responsibility.</p>

<h3>Taking Inventory</h3>

<p>As new stewards of ExpressionEngine, we examined the CMS landscape (and accompanying technologies) to not only see where things <em>are,</em> but more importantly where content management needed to <em>go.</em>
With this mindset, and the EE community in view, it was clear we needed to go beyond the baseline capabilities of 6.0, 6.1, 6.2, etc. We had to raise the bar. We had to push the borders and boundaries.</p>

<h3>Something New</h3>

<p>So we began to ponder&#8230; is there a different paradigm we should consider for the management of ExpressionEngine sites? One that wouldn&#8217;t compromise what ExpressionEngine already is, but could add to the power and flexibility we&#8217;ve all grown accustomed to? What does the future of ExpressionEngine look like? What would it look like to break outside of the confines of the Control Panel?</p>

<p>These types of questions led to the origin of <em>ExpressionEngine Pro.</em></p>

<p>ExpressionEngine Pro was created with the notion that we can pull off <em>not only</em> front-end editing, but full-featured content administration and all of its underlying technology in a streamlined, more efficient, and effective manner than the basic front-end editing methods that exist in other products.</p>

<p>And after two years of hard work, we&#8217;re happy to share the results with you today!</p>

<h3>Meet ExpressionEngine Pro</h3>

<p><a href="https://expressionengine.com/pro">ExpressionEngine Pro</a> adds new layers of features and flexibility to your existing EE sites, including:</p>

<p><strong>Front-End Editing:</strong> Pro makes managing your site&#8217;s content as streamlined as possible. See something you want to change? Enter edit mode and start making your updates directly on the front-end. It’s as simple as that.</p>

<p><strong>The Dock:</strong> The Dock in ExpressionEngine Pro is your front-end command center. It lets you jump into Edit mode to access all of your site&#8217;s content, as well as other features to fine-tune your site&#8217;s functionality.</p>

<p><strong>Add-On Prolets:</strong> Prolets in ExpressionEngine Pro allow you to access the essence of add-ons that are crucial to your site&#8217;s operation, all while browsing the front end of your site.</p>

<p><strong>Member Permissions:</strong> ExpressionEngine Pro intelligently picks up existing user permissions to determine which channels and add-on Prolets a given user can access.</p>

<p><strong>Front-End Entries:</strong> Beyond front-end editing, you can also access your entries listing to quickly and easily access content well beyond the page you&#8217;re currently viewing.</p>

<p><strong>Custom Dashboard:</strong> Easily bring per-site or per-user information front and center. Custom dashboard widgets open the door to third-party applications and services, which easily surface important information.</p>

<p><strong>White Labeling:</strong> ExpressionEngine Pro also introduces the initial steps into white labeling, easily allowing you to add a custom login logo and favicon. (More to come!)</p>

<p><strong>Low Variables:</strong> Tried and true. ExpressionEngine Pro comes with Low Variables, giving you a single interface to manage, create, and edit site-wide variables made from all of the complex fields ExpressionEngine offers.</p>

<p><strong>Low Search:</strong> Pulling the power of Low Search into ExpressionEngine Pro brings with it full-text indexing as well as greater relevance in results by weighting any searchable field.
These features (and more!) will take your existing ExpressionEngine sites and <em>turn them up to 11!</em></p>

<h3>Get Started</h3>

<p>ExpressionEngine Pro is included with EE 6.1 and can be installed on top of any existing ExpressionEngine 6 site, including sites that have been upgraded from older versions.</p>

<p>We’re also happy to share that ExpressionEngine Pro is free to use in local development, but will require a paid license to run on a production site.  For a quick demo, <a href="https://u.expressionengine.com/article/quick-overview-of-expressionengine-pro">check out this video!</a></p>

<p>For more information on ExpressionEngine Pro, we encourage you to <a href="https://expressionengine.com/pro">check out the new Pro page on the site.</a></p>

<p>ExpressionEngine Pro will be $50 off for the first year until next Friday (October 15th). For more info on the pricing of Pro, <a href="/store/purchase-pro">check out the pricing page.</a></p>

<p>And finally, thanks to everyone in the EE community for your support and encouragement over the last year. It feels great to finally deliver this release into your hands!</p>

<p>Welcome to the new era!</p>

				<p>Today we&#8217;re excited to share the first major update to ExpressionEngine version 6!</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s unpack it a bit!</p>

<p>For starters, we&#8217;re excited to share that ExpressionEngine Pro is shipping inside the 6.1 release!  <a href="https://expressionengine.com/blog/introducing-expressionengine-pro">For more info on Pro and what it is, check out the Pro release announcement.</a></p>

<h4>Rich Text Editor</h4>

<p>Version 6 contained a major update to the Rich Text Editor (RTE) field with the inclusion of CKEditor 5.  In version 6.1 we’ve built upon that by adding the option to choose Redactor as well.</p>

<h4>Command Line Interface</h4>

<p>Similarly, in version 6, we also introduced the base of the new Command Line Interface (CLI).  We&#8217;re happy to share that in version 6.1 the CLI has taken a big step forward with the addition of commands for cache, make and migrate. These should greatly enable developers to get to the heart of their work faster.</p>

<h4>Cookies</h4>

<p>Earlier this year we held an open forum to discuss the ever changing cookie laws throughout the world, and how to better position ExpressionEngine to accommodate the cookie laws across different countries.  As a result of this call, version 6.1 has some substantial changes to how cookies are handled. The following is a quick summary of the changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>All consents are now logged (including guests)</li>
<li>Removed as many cookies as possible</li>
<li>Converted all front-end cookies to session cookies</li>
<li>Added consent versions to the Audit Log.</li>
</ul>

<p>ExpressionEngine Pro also substantially enhances your cookie options and gives you fine tune control over cookie settings throughout the core and add-ons.</p>

<h4>reCAPTCHA V3</h4>

<p>We&#8217;ve also added reCAPTCHA support as an additional CAPTCHA option in version 6.1  We specifically chose version 3 as it has better accessibility.</p>

<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg. <a href="https://docs.expressionengine.com/latest/installation/changelog.html">Take a peek at the change log for all details!</a></p>

				<p>ExpressionEngine support has always been known for its fast response times and reliable results.  Today we&#8217;re happy to announce that the <a href="https://expressionengine.com/support">ExpressionEngine Support</a> plans will also cover all <a href="https://eeharbor.com/">EEHarbor</a> add-ons.</p>

<h3>How do I use it?</h3>

<p>If you have an existing support plan for ExpressionEngine, you can now submit support tickets for any EEHarbor add-ons as well, right from your support portal!</p>

<h3>What&#8217;s the difference?</h3>

<p>Tickets for EEHarbor add-ons submitted through the official ExpressionEngine Support system will fall into the same response timelines as your support plan.  In addition to this, you get the same depth of support for EEHarbor add-ons as you would for your ExpressionEngine installs, including logging into your install or server if need be.</p>

				<h1>It&#8217;s Here!</h1>

<p>It&#8217;s with great excitement and anticipation that today we announce the public release of ExpressionEngine 6.  ExpressionEngine version 6 in many ways represents more than just a new major version; it&#8217;s also the dawn of a new era in the ExpressionEngine world.</p>

<p>ExpressionEngine 6 from the start has been all about elevating the user experience. From the new interface, refined interactions, functionality and new feature additions.

<p>It&#8217;s with great excitement and anticipation that today we announce the public release of ExpressionEngine 6.  ExpressionEngine version 6 in many ways represents more than just a new major version; it&#8217;s also the dawn of a new era in the ExpressionEngine world.</p>

<p>ExpressionEngine 6 from the start has been all about elevating the user experience. From the new interface, refined interactions, functionality and new feature additions. It’s all designed to give you the best user experience. To say version 6 was a large undertaking would be an understatement. Beyond the new user experience ExpressionEngine 6 is also setting the stage for what’s to come.</p>

				<p>In our recent ExpressionEngine 6 update, we mentioned that ExpressionEngine 6 will be a Long Term Support release (LTS) and maintain support for 5 years.  In this post we want to provide a bit more clarification around what this means and what it will look like going forward.</p>

<p>Will there be breaking changes in ExpressionEngine 6 over the 5 years?</p>

<p>Since ExpressionEngine adopted semantic versioning, any breaking changes would have to be implemented in a major release (version 7, 8 etc).  As such, ExpressionEngine 6  will remain consistent with that methodology and won&#8217;t introduce any breaking changes in the 5-year support period.</p>

<p>Will there be new feature additions to ExpressionEngine 6?</p>

<p>Over the course of the 5 years, it is our intention for there to be new feature additions for the first 2-3 years.  Throughout the remaining years, we anticipate most active development of new features to be on version 7 and 8.</p>

<p>Will version 6 stay up to date with PHP and MySQL versions for the full 5 years?</p>

<p>Yes, version 6 will also stay up to date with new PHP and MySQL versions for the 5-year LTS release. So long as those PHP and MySQL versions do not introduce breaking changes to ExpressionEngine 6 we will support them. Out of the gate, we have decided to support PHP 5.6 +.  We&#8217;ve made this decision based on the number of sites currently running on older versions of ExpressionEngine and PHP.  Since PHP 5.6 through 7.1 are considered end of life, we do plan on rolling support for these php versions off, as we believe it would be irresponsible to provide support for them over the next 5 years.  At some point in the future we will drop support for these versions of PHP.  Similarly, we will pick up support for the upcoming PHP 8 release as well as any other new releases in the 5 year LTS timeline.</p>

<p>Will other versions of ExpressionEngine be released while version 6 is still supported?</p>

<p>During the 5 year LTS arc, it&#8217;s our plan to also release ExpressionEngine version 7 and 8.  We can safely say ExpressionEngine 7 will not be an LTS release.  We&#8217;re currently undecided on whether version 8 will be LTS or not.  If version 8 isn&#8217;t an LTS release, the next release will be.  It&#8217;s our plan to aim for an approximate 1 year overlap between LTS versions of ExpressionEngine going forward.  We believe this approach will provide a constant, stable, long-term platform for organizations to rely on, with plenty of time to move from one LTS release to another.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>So why did we decide to make ExpressionEngine 6 an LTS release?</p>

<p>Simply put, we believe LTS is a tried-and-true methodology for software, and it gives us the ability to provide a stable and supported platform that many organizations rely on.  At the same time, it presents an opportunity to set the trajectory we believe CMS&#8217;s on a global scale should head.  As such, we will iterate, innovate, and improve the product on an ongoing basis.
If you&#8217;re running an older version of ExpressionEngine, this is the time to upgrade.</p>

				<p>At the recent <a href="https://www.eeconf.com/">ExpressionEngine Conference</a> (EEConf 2020), we had the opportunity to present to almost 400 attendees, give an update on the status of version 6, and share a few details about ExpressionEngine 6 that we hadn&#8217;t yet made public.  For the many people who didn&#8217;t have the opportunity to attend, the following is a recap of some of the updates we are most excited about.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For starters, ExpressionEngine 6 public beta will be released <strong>this Wednesday (10/14/2020)</strong></p></li>
<li><p>ExpressionEngine 6 will be an <strong>LTS (Long Term Support)</strong> release.  As such, it will be <strong>supported for 5 years</strong>, and will receive NO breaking changes in that time.  Additional blog post on this to follow.</p></li>
<li><p>In ExpressionEngine 5.4 and 6, you will now be able to upgrade <strong>directly from older versions</strong> of ExpressionEngine to 6.  This means no more stopping at version 3, 4, and 5.  In addition to this, it will also notify you of potential upgrade issues upon completion.</p></li>
<li><p>In ExpressionEngine 6, we&#8217;re excited to release the <a href="https://youtu.be/DqhPSPHPLc4"><strong>Jump Menu</strong></a>.  Introducing a new paradigm in CMS navigation.  <a href="https://youtu.be/DqhPSPHPLc4">Check out this video for a quick demo</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>While it won&#8217;t be in the initial 6.0 release, 6.0 will eventually <strong>add support for twig</strong> templates as well as the native templating language.  Our plan is to allow developers to choose which template parser they would like to use for a given template.</p></li>
